## 📚 Part 1: Theoretical Analysis

### Q1: Edge AI — Latency Reduction and Privacy
Edge AI reduces latency by performing computations directly on local devices (e.g., Raspberry Pi, mobile phones), bypassing the need to send data to the cloud. This speeds up decision-making and enhances privacy by keeping sensitive data on-device.  
**Example:** Autonomous drones using onboard AI for obstacle detection and navigation, avoiding cloud delays.

### Q2: Quantum AI vs Classical AI
Quantum AI leverages quantum computing principles (superposition, entanglement) to solve optimization problems exponentially faster than classical AI.  
**Key Advantage:** Quantum speed-up in areas like drug discovery, logistics, and finance.  
**Industries Benefiting Most:** Healthcare, pharmaceuticals, logistics (e.g., route optimization), cryptography.

### Q3: Human-AI Collaboration in Healthcare
AI tools like diagnostic imaging assistants can support radiologists in detecting anomalies faster. Nurses can use predictive tools for early detection of patient deterioration.  
**Impact:** Redefines roles into supervisory, interpretive, and empathetic tasks — improving patient care, not replacing professionals.
