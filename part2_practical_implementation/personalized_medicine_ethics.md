# Ethics in Personalized Medicine

##  Potential Biases

One major concern in AI-driven personalized medicine is **underrepresentation of ethnic groups** in training datasets like TCGA. Most genomic studies heavily sample individuals from North American or European populations, leading to:

- Reduced model accuracy for minorities
- Skewed treatment recommendations
- Increased health disparities

This means the AI may recommend ineffective or even harmful treatments for underrepresented groups.

##  Fairness Strategies

To mitigate these biases, the following strategies can be applied:

1. **Diversify the Training Data**:  
   Curate inclusive datasets that represent a broader range of ethnicities and demographics.

2. **Bias Auditing Tools**:  
   Use tools like Aequitas or Fairlearn to detect bias in model outputs.

3. **Model Transparency**:  
   Ensure decisions can be traced and explained, especially when applied in clinical contexts.

4. **Ethical Review Boards**:  
   Include bioethics experts and diverse patient advocates during AI system design and deployment.

##  Final Reflection

As AI becomes more embedded in treatment workflows, maintaining **equity** across patient populations is crucial. Developers must be proactive in identifying hidden bias before clinical implementation.
